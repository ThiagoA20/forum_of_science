just don't be an assole or your ip address will be banned.
Other wise, have fun and let's try to build a homemade ion thruster together,  friend! :)

with assole, i mean:
. making spam
. trying to hack some user or taking down the website
. trying to censor someone
(if someone is being racist, pedophile, sexist, religious intolerant, xenophobic or any other type of toxic person,
just block it, because the site will automatically decrease their ability to interact and credibility.
this is the best way to repudiate this behavior, since "canceling" someone doesn't change their mind,
only dialogue can do that, you know this because you are a smart person, I'm just talking to make it clear,
so if you asking other people to block someone, you will be banned. Because real freedom of expression is valued
here, so users who have good behavior will gradually increase their credibility, while toxic users will quickly
decrease their credibility. So you can decide based on the person's credibility whether or not to interact with that
person. Moreover, the greater your reliability, the greater the chance that your articles and posts will be
recommended by the algorithm)
. share links  of scams
